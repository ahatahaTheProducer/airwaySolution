# airwaySolution
In this project we are finding the ways with minimum cost to travel from one location to another.
The detailed description is in the documentation.pdf file the expected outputs are in outputs folder and what my program outs are in myouts folder. These folders are all in required folders folder. In order to have the program run expectedly, you need to extract the requiredFolder.zip. So that the program knows where it is.

There may be minor problems in the code. Please reach me if you find any. Any help is appriciated. 

Thanks
